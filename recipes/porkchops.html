    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pork Chops of any cut</li>
        <li>2 Beaten Eggs</li>
        <li>Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>Italian-style seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 35 degrees.</li>
        <li>Rinse pork chops, pat dry, and season with garlic powder and seasoning salt. Place the beaten eggs in a small bowl. Dredge the pork chops lightly in flour, dip in the egg, and coat liberally with bread crumbs.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the pork chops until the breading appears well browned, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer the chops to a 9x13-inch baking dish, and cover with foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. While baking, combine the cream of mushroom soup, milk, and white wine in a medium bowl. Cover the pork chops with the soup mixture. Replace foil, and continue to bake for another 30 minutes.</li>
